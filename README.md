- mobile first
- grid- and size-classes are configurable
- responsive
- low-specifity selectors
- fractions are toggable/configurable (eg. `desktop-1-1` or `desktop-1-of-1`)
- equal height columns (via class)
- reversible (via class)
- gutterless (via class)
- animations (turned off by default)
- push- and pull-classes

## browser support
- IE >= 9 (8 is supported in general by the grid but equal heights won't work)
- all other modern browsers you shouldn't care about
